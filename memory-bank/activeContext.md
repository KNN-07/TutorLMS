# Active Context: TutorLMS

## Current Work Focus

### Project Status: **Initialization Phase**
- **Current Task**: Memory Bank initialization complete
- **Next Priority**: Project foundation setup (directory structure, initial configurations)
- **Active Development**: Pre-development phase - establishing project architecture

### Recent Memory Bank Creation
- ✅ Created core Memory Bank structure
- ✅ Documented project brief and requirements
- ✅ Established product context and user experience goals
- ✅ Defined system architecture patterns
- ✅ Documented technical stack and development setup

## Next Steps (Immediate)

### 1. Project Structure Setup
- Create backend directory structure following FastAPI best practices
- Create frontend directory structure following React/TypeScript conventions
- Set up Docker Compose for development environment
- Initialize version control with proper .gitignore files

### 2. Backend Foundation
- Set up FastAPI application with basic configuration
- Configure SQLAlchemy with PostgreSQL database models
- Implement basic authentication structure (JWT)
- Create database migration system with Alembic
- Set up testing framework with pytest

### 3. Frontend Foundation
- Initialize React application with TypeScript
- Configure Tailwind CSS for styling
- Set up Redux Toolkit for state management
- Implement basic routing structure
- Create component library foundation

### 4. Development Environment
- Configure Docker containers for PostgreSQL and Redis
- Set up environment variable management
- Create development scripts for easy startup
- Configure linting and code formatting tools

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Architecture Decisions Made
1. **Monorepo Structure**: Frontend and backend in same repository for easier development
2. **Database Choice**: PostgreSQL for robust relational data handling
3. **Authentication Strategy**: JWT with refresh token rotation
4. **API Design**: RESTful API with FastAPI auto-documentation
5. **State Management**: Redux Toolkit for predictable state updates

### Technology Choices Ratified
- **Backend**: FastAPI (chosen for async support and auto-documentation)
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript (chosen for type safety and ecosystem)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (chosen for ACID compliance and JSON support)
- **Caching**: Redis (chosen for session management and performance)
- **Deployment**: Docker + Docker Compose (chosen for environment consistency)

### Key Design Patterns to Implement
1. **Repository Pattern**: Clean separation of data access logic
2. **Service Layer Pattern**: Business logic encapsulation
3. **Strategy Pattern**: Adaptive testing algorithm flexibility
4. **Observer Pattern**: Real-time analytics and progress tracking
5. **Factory Pattern**: Question type generation and management

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Code Organization Principles
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between layers
- **Dependency Injection**: Testable and maintainable code structure
- **Async-First Design**: Non-blocking operations throughout the stack
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing in both TypeScript and Python
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with proper logging

### Development Standards
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests, integration tests, and E2E tests
- **Code Quality**: Linting, formatting, and type checking enforced
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated API docs and comprehensive README files
- **Security**: Input validation, authentication, and authorization at all levels

### UI/UX Principles
- **Mobile-First Design**: Responsive layouts for all screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 compliance for inclusive design
- **Performance**: Optimized loading times and smooth interactions
- **User-Centered**: Clear navigation and intuitive user flows

## Project Learning & Insights

### Digital SAT Requirements Understanding
- Adaptive testing mimics real Digital SAT format
- Section-based timing requirements (Reading, Writing, Math)
- Question difficulty adjustment based on performance
- Comprehensive analytics for performance tracking
- Multimedia content support for engaging learning

### Technical Complexity Considerations
- **Adaptive Algorithm Implementation**: Requires sophisticated question selection logic
- **Real-time Performance**: WebSocket connections for live test updates
- **Data Analytics**: Complex aggregation and reporting requirements
- **Scalability**: Concurrent test sessions and user management
- **Content Management**: Flexible system for various question types and media

### Development Approach
- **Iterative Development**: Build core features first, then enhance
- **API-First Design**: Backend API development before frontend implementation
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with basic features, add complexity gradually
- **Testing Integration**: Test-driven development where appropriate
- **Documentation-Driven**: Maintain comprehensive documentation throughout

## Current Environment State

### Repository Status
- Basic repository structure with Memory Bank initialized
- README.md contains project overview and requirements
- .clinerules established for development workflow
- Git repository initialized (evidence from .git directory)

### Development Setup Status
- **Not Started**: Backend directory structure
- **Not Started**: Frontend directory structure
- **Not Started**: Docker Compose configuration
- **Not Started**: Database setup and migrations
- **Not Started**: Basic application scaffolding

### Dependencies Status
- **Not Installed**: Python dependencies and virtual environment
- **Not Installed**: Node.js dependencies and packages
- **Not Installed**: Development tools and linters
- **Not Configured**: Environment variables and configuration files

## Immediate Action Items

### Priority 1: Foundation Setup
1. Create project directory structure (frontend/ and backend/)
2. Initialize Python virtual environment and FastAPI application
3. Initialize React application with TypeScript
4. Set up Docker Compose for development services

### Priority 2: Basic Configuration
1. Configure database models and migrations
2. Set up authentication and authorization framework
3. Create basic API endpoints structure
4. Implement basic frontend routing and components

### Priority 3: Development Tools
1. Configure linting and formatting tools
2. Set up testing frameworks
3. Create development scripts and documentation
4. Initialize CI/CD pipeline considerations

## Context for Future Development

### Key Files to Monitor
- `backend/app/main.py` - FastAPI application entry point
- `frontend/src/App.tsx` - React application root
- `docker-compose.yml` - Development environment configuration
- `backend/alembic/` - Database migration files
- `backend/app/models/` - Database models and relationships

### Integration Points to Consider
- Authentication flow between frontend and backend
- Real-time updates for test sessions
- File upload and storage for multimedia content
- Analytics data collection and processing
- Adaptive algorithm implementation and testing

This active context will be updated as development progresses and new insights are gained.
