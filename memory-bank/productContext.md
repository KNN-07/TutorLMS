# Product Context: TutorLMS

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement
The Digital SAT represents a significant shift in standardized testing, moving from paper-based to computer-adaptive testing. Students need specialized preparation platforms that:
- Simulate the actual Digital SAT experience
- Provide adaptive testing that mirrors the real exam format
- Offer comprehensive analytics to identify strengths and weaknesses
- Support multimedia content delivery for engaging learning

### Market Gap
Current SAT preparation solutions often lack:
- True adaptive testing capabilities
- Comprehensive performance analytics
- Modern, engaging user interfaces
- Integrated multimedia content management
- Scalable architecture for educational institutions

### Target Audience
**Primary Users:**
- High school students preparing for Digital SAT
- SAT tutors and educators
- Educational institutions offering SAT prep programs

**Secondary Users:**
- Parents tracking student progress
- School administrators managing SAT prep programs

## How It Should Work
